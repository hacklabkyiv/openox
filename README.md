# OpenOX MKI: OSHW Oxygen Concentrator

![General](general-view.jpg)

**OpenOx** is a project of open-source hardware oxygen concentrator. It has a simple design and is optimized for fast production. The oxygen concentration level of the output gas ranges from 85% to 95%. Flow from 1 to 6 LPM. The oxygen is delivered to the patient through the use of a nasal cannula. The OpenOx concentrator uses a molecular sieve and pressure swing adsorption methodology to produce the oxygen gas output. Ambient air enters the device, is filtered and then compressed. This compressed air is then directed toward one of two nitrogen adsorbing sieve beds. Concentrated oxygen exits the opposite end of the active sieve bed and is directed into an oxygen reservoir where it is delivered to the patient.


### Technical Specification

OpenOx has flexible and modular design, therefore techical specification can vary depending on choosen components. In basic configuration they are:

| Property            | Value            |
| --------------------| ---------------- |
| Max oxygen flow     | 6 LPM            |
| Oxygen concentration| 85-95 %          |
| Power consumption   | 580 W            |
| Dimensions          | 550mmx400mmx300mm|
| Weight              | 20 kg            |
